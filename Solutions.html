    <h1 style="color:Yellow;font-size:300%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"">Solutions</h1>
    <p style="color:lightgreen;font-size:130%;margin:0px;padding:10px;border:10px">In 2015, world leaders signed a major treaty called the Paris agreement, to put these solutions into practice. Core to all climate change solutions is reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which must get to zero as soon as possible. Because both forests and oceans play vitally important roles in regulating our climate, increasing the natural ability of forests and oceans to absorb carbon dioxide can also help stop global warming.</p>
    <p style="color:lightgreen;font-size:120%;margin:0px;padding:10px;border:20px">The main ways to stop climate change are to pressure government and business to:</p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:110%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:10px;border:10px"><b>1.Keep fossil fuels in the ground.</b></p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:100%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:20px;border:10px">Fossil fuels include coal, oil and gas – and the more that are extracted and burned, the worse climate change will get. All countries need to move their economies away from fossil fuels as soon as possible.</p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:110%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:10px;border:10px"><b>2.Invest in renewable energy.</b></p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:100%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:20px;border:10px">Changing our main energy sources to clean and renewable energy is the best way to stop using fossil fuels. These include technologies like solar, wind, wave, tidal and geothermal power.</p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:110%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:10px;border:10px"><b>3.Switch to sustainable transport.</b></p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:100%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:20px;border:10px">Petrol and diesel vehicles, planes and ships use fossil fuels. Reducing car use, switching to electric vehicles and minimising plane travel will not only help stop climate change, it will reduce air pollution too.</p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:110%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:10px;border:10px"><b>4.Help us keep our homes cosy.</b></p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:100%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:20px;border:10px">Homes shouldn’t be draughty and cold – it’s a waste of money, and miserable in the winter. The government can help households heat our homes in a green way – such as by insulating walls and roofs and switching away from oil or gas boilers to heat pumps.</p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:110%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:10px;border:10px"><b>5.Improve farming and encourage vegan diets.</b></p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:100%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:20px;border:10px">One of the best ways for individuals to help stop climate change is by reducing their meat and dairy consumption, or by going fully vegan. Businesses and food retailers can improve farming practices and provide more plant-based products to help people make the shift.</p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:110%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:10px;border:10px"><b>6.Restore nature to absorb more carbon.</b></p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:100%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:20px;border:10px">The natural world is very good at cleaning up our emissions, but we need to look after it. Planting trees in the right places or giving land back to nature through ‘rewilding’ schemes is a good place to start. This is because photosynthesising plants draw down carbon dioxide as they grow, locking it away in soils.</p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:110%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:10px;border:10px"><b>7.Protect the oceans and forests.</b></p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:100%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:20px;border:10px">Forests are crucial in the fight against climate change, and protecting them is an important climate solution. Cutting down forests on an industrial scale destroys giant trees which could be sucking up huge amounts of carbon. Yet companies destroy forests to make way for animal farming, soya or palm oil plantations. Governments can stop them by making better laws. Oceans also absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps to keep our climate stable. But many are overfished, used for oil and gas drilling or threatened by deep sea mining. Protecting oceans and the life in them is ultimately a way to protect ourselves from climate change.</p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:110%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:10px;border:10px"><b>8.Reduce plastic.</b></p>
    <p style="color:White;font-size:100%;text-align:left;margin:0px;padding:20px;border:10px">Plastic is made from oil, and the process of extracting, refining and turning oil into plastic (or even polyester, for clothing) is surprisingly carbon-intense. It doesn’t break down quickly in nature so a lot of plastic is burned, which contributes to emissions. Demand for plastic is rising so quickly that creating and disposing of plastics will account for 17% of the global carbon budget by 2050 (this is the emissions count we need to stay within according to the Paris agreement).</p>
    <p style="color:lightgreen;font-size:120%;margin:0px;padding:10px;border:30px">To work, all of these solutions need strong international cooperation between governments and businesses, including the most polluting sectors. But, the best way for anyone to help stop climate change is to take collective action. This means pressuring governments and corporations to change their policies and business practices is a powerful way to make change happen.</p>
